# ElvUI_HealerMana
This is a proof-of-concept plugin for ElvUI to only show healer mana bars on groupframes and raidframes.

Except things to be wonky, and make a backup for your profile! Things still don't work 100% out, for exaple people leaving / joining the group or changing roles. You need to click "show frames" two times in the specificic ElvUI frame option to apply the selective display for now.
